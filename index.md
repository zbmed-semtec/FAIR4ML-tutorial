## Description

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence require data and software to create machine/deep learning models (abbreviated as ML models). 
In 2016, the [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) were introduced with data as their main target. 
In 2022 a variation for research software ([FAIR4RS](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)) was published. 
FAIRness for machine learning has been discussed at different forums, one of them being the [Research Data Alliance FAIR4ML Interest Group (RDA FAIR4ML IG)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-machine-learning-fair4ml-ig). 
FAIRness heavily relies on good practices for documentation (human-oriented FAIRness) and metadata (machine-actionable FAIRness). 
As part of the [NFDI4DataScience](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/), and together with RDA FAIR4ML IG, we are creating a metadata layer to describe ML models ([FAIR4ML](https://w3id.org/fair4ml)). 
This 90-minute tutorial will introduce ML model cards (documentation for humans) and FAIR4ML (machine-actionable metadata for machines), 
showcasing its use in the NFDI4DataScience **MLentory** –a registry for ML models, so attendees get familiar with and adopt some good practices for ML models, promoting a more reliable and impactful data science and artificial intelligence landscape.

## Audience and requirements

This tutorial targets researchers across all domains working on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence fields, from beginners to experienced researchers, interested in improving practices towards documentation and metadata for ML models. 
As we will work on good practices to care and share your own ML models, it would be good if you have one at hand (it does not have to be public, it can be still work in progress). Please bring your laptop.
